### Future Scope:
   In a landscape where 13 million small 'kirana' shops in India struggle with outdated systems, Esaadhan's innovative resource pooling feature holds immense promise. By leveraging location-based resource pooling and shared delivery personnel, Esaadhan empowers local shops to efficiently manage their operations, reducing overhead costs significantly. This collaborative approach enables these local shops to compete effectively with large retailers, optimizing their resources and enhancing their competitiveness in the market.
